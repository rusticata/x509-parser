### Thanks

- @lilyball for numerous issues, ideas and comments

## 0.9.3

### Added/Changed/Fixed

- Add functions oid2description() and oid_registry() (closes #79)
- Fix typo 'ocsp_signing' (closes #84)
- Extension: use specific variant if unsupported or failed to parse (closes #83)
- Relax constrains on parsing to accept certificates that do not strictly respect
  DER encoding, but are widely accepted by other X.509 libraries:
  - SubjectAltName: accept non-ia5string characters
  - Extensions: accept boolean values not enoded as `00` or `ff`
  - Serial: build BigUint from raw bytes (do not check sign)

## 0.9.2

- Remove der-oid-macro from dependencies, not used directly
- Use der_parser::num_bigint, remove it from direct dependencies
- Add methods to iterate all blocks from a PEM file (#75)

### Thanks

- @0xazure for fixing X509Name::iter_state_or_province

## 0.9.0

### Added/Changed/Fixed

- Upgrade to `nom` 6.0
- Upgrade to `der-parser` 5.0
- Upgrade MSRV to 1.44.0
- Re-export crates so crate users do not have to import them

- Add function parse_x509_pem and deprecate pem_to_der (#53)
- Add helper methods to X509Name and simplify accessing values
- Add support for ReasonCode extension
- Add support for InvalidityDate extension
- Add support for CRL Number extension
- Add support for Certificate Signing Request (#58)

- Change type of X509Version (now directly using the u32 value)

### Thanks

## 0.8.0

### Added/Changed

- Upgrade to `der-parser` 4.0
- Move from `time` to `chrono`
  - `time 0.1 is very old, and time 0.2 broke compatibility and cannot parse timezones
  - Add public type `ASN1Time` object to abstract implementation
  - *this breaks API for direct access to `not_before`, `not_after` etc.*
- Fix clippy warnings
  - `nid2obj` argument is now passed by copy, not reference
- Add method to get a formatted string of the certificate serial number
- Add method to get decoded version
- Add convenience methods to access the most common fields (subject, issuer, etc.)
- Expose the raw DER of an X509Name
- Make `parse_x509_name` public, for parsing distinguished names
- Make OID objects public
- Implement parsing for some extensions
  - Support for extensions is not complete, support for more types will be added later
- Add example to decode and print certificates
- Add `verify` feature to verify cryptographic signature by a public key

### Fixed

- Fix parsing of types not representable by string in X509Name (#36)
- Fix parsing of certificates with empty subject (#37)

### Thanks

- @jannschu, @g2p for the extensions parsing
- @wayofthepie for the tests and contributions
- @nicholasbishop for contributions
